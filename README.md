# Word Hunt Solver

A solver for the popular GamePidgeon game Word Hunt.

# What is WordHunt?

Word Hunt is essentially a fresh take on Boggle. A randomly generated 4x4 grid of letters is given to two players along with a 90-second time limit. The objective is to make as many words as you can by sliding your finger across the touchscreen board, and the winner is the one with the most points at the end. Words scale in points based on their length, so the game is a balance between making as many words as possible, while also keeping an eye on those juicy big-word opportunities.

# How It Works
It uses a Trie class and a recursive backtracking algorithm to find all possible words. It then sorts and prints the words for the user.
